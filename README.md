  Giveth v2
</h1>

## ðŸš€ Quick start
Giveth-2 is a reimagined version of the ["Giveth donation application"](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-dapp). Users leverage the Ethereum blockchain to distribute and track their donations or enable unstoppable funding for their campaign.

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**
The projects aims to simplify the application's options to enable new users without blockchain experience a frictionless experience.

The project is currently in heavy development and does not offer all functionality that is needed for an MVP state (first release goal).

## Contributor's guide

1.  **Clone and install the backend server**

    In order to develop locally you need to clone the backend server as well. We are using https://github.com/topiahq/impact-graph for this. Please follow the readme of `impact-graph` to install it. For more detailed instructions specific to giveth2 please refer to this [gist](https://gist.github.com/geleeroyale/6283549c469f2fa89fc059f936c59002).

1.  **Clone and install the frontend (this repo)**
	First, please star and follow this repository.
	```bash
	git clone git@github.com:Giveth/giveth-2.git
	cd giveth-2
	npm i
	```
    
1.  **Set up the development environment**
	
	```bash
	cp .env.example .env.development
	```
	To get the necessary information for local development, please [ask in giveth-2 developer chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!zFyfjCfKHawjZJcueK:matrix.org?via=matrix.org)

1.  **Start developing.**
	Make sure that the backend server is running (Step1)
    Navigate into the giveth-2 directory and start up the local development server.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
